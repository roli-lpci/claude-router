## Category 1: EVALUATION (Judge Agent Outputs 1-10)

Ground truth scores and how close each condition got:

| Task | Ground Truth | A (Haiku Raw) | B (Haiku Scaffolded) | C (Sonnet Raw) |
|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| eval_01: Overconfident code fix | 4 | 8 (+4) | 8 (+4) | 7 (+3) |
| eval_02: Verbose summary | 7 | 2 (-5) [MISS] | 5 (-2) | 5 (-2) |
| eval_03: Hallucinated citation | 2 | 2 (0) [OK] | 2 (0) [OK] | 1 (-1) |
| eval_04: Correct refusal | 9 | 9 (0) [OK] | 8 (-1) | 9 (0) [OK] |
| eval_05: Partial complexity | 5 | 8 (+3) | 5 (0) [OK] | 5 (0) [OK] |
| eval_06: Sycophantic eval() | 1 | 1 (0) [OK] | 2 (+1) | 1 (0) [OK] |
| eval_07: Generic email | 5 | 7 (+2) | 4 (-1) | 5 (0) [OK] |
| eval_08: Good technical | 9 | 9 (0) [OK] | 8 (-1) | 5 (-4) [MISS] |
| eval_09: Wrong question | 3 | 5 (+2) | 3 (0) [OK] | 4 (+1) |
| eval_10: Hedged non-answer | 3 | 6 (+3) | 3 (0) [OK] | 2 (-1) |

### Calibration Error (|score - ground_truth|, lower = better)
| Condition | Mean Absolute Error | Perfect Scores (error=0) | Within ±1 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **A (Haiku Raw)** | **2.0** | 3/10 | 3/10 |
| **B (Haiku Scaffolded)** | **1.0** | **5/10** | **9/10** |
| **C (Sonnet Raw)** | **1.2** | **5/10** | 8/10 |

### EVALUATION FINDINGS:
- **B (scaffolded Haiku) beats A (raw Haiku) by 1.0pp MAE** — halved the calibration error
- **B matches Sonnet on perfect scores (5/10 each)** and edges it on within-±1 (9 vs 8)
- **B is BETTER calibrated than Sonnet** on: eval_05 (caught O(1) space error), eval_09 (caught wrong-question), eval_10 (caught hedging)
- **Sonnet fumbled eval_08** (scored 5 for excellent technical explanation due to nitpicking "backpressure" terminology)
- **Raw Haiku's worst failure:** eval_02 — scored the verbose summary 2/10 (ground truth 7). Mistakenly flagged statistics as hallucinated when they were given in the prompt. The scaffold fixed this (B scored 5).
- **Scaffolding effect on overcorrection:** A overcorrected high (8 for GT=4, 8 for GT=5, 6 for GT=3). B did not overcorrect — stayed closer to ground truth on ALL tasks.

## Category 2: MULTI-CONTEXT RETENTION

| Task | A (Haiku Raw) | B (Haiku Scaffolded) | C (Sonnet Raw) |
|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| ctx_01: Budget lookup | [OK] Correct | [OK] Correct | [OK] Correct |
| ctx_02: Priority cross-ref | [OK] Correct (JWT first) | [OK] Correct + cross-ref | [OK] Correct + reasoning |
| ctx_03: Production outage | [OK] Correct (Dave) | [OK] Correct + explains all 4 | [OK] Correct + Alice caveat |
| ctx_04: DB change timeline | [OK] Correct | [OK] Correct | [OK] Correct |
| ctx_05: Priority conflict | [OK] Correct (CVE > billing) | [OK] Correct | [OK] Correct + comms plan |

### Context Scoring (0-10 per task, based on correctness + attribution + completeness)
| Condition | ctx_01 | ctx_02 | ctx_03 | ctx_04 | ctx_05 | **Mean** |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| A (Haiku Raw) | 10 | 7 | 9 | 8 | 8 | **8.4** |
| B (Haiku Scaffolded) | 10 | 9 | 10 | 9 | 8 | **9.2** |
| C (Sonnet Raw) | 10 | 9 | 10 | 9 | 10 | **9.6** |

### CONTEXT FINDINGS:
- **All three got every answer factually correct** — no hallucinations or mixups
- **B improved over A by +0.8** — better attribution and completeness (the contrastive markers "answer ONLY from context, NOT general knowledge" worked)
- **C (Sonnet) wins by +0.4 over B** — Sonnet's ctx_05 response included a proactive communication plan that neither Haiku version provided
- **Scaffolding closed 67% of the gap** between raw Haiku and Sonnet on this category (A=8.4, B=9.2, C=9.6; gap A→C=1.2, gap B→C=0.4)

## Category 3: MULTI-STEP WITH STATE

| Task | A (Haiku Raw) | B (Haiku Scaffolded) | C (Sonnet Raw) |
|------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| step_01 (extract→filter→mailto) | [OK] All 3 steps correct | [~] Step 3a: missed 1 GET /users (counted 4 not 5) | [~] Same miss (4 not 5) |
| step_02 (rank→hypothesize→plan) | [OK] Ranked A>C>B, good hypothesis | [OK] Same ranking, good hypothesis | [~] Ranked C>A>B (debatable) |
| step_03 (parse→calculate→report) | [OK] Correct counts, rates, summary | [~] GET /users counted 4 not 5 | [~] Same miss |

### Multi-Step Scoring (0-10 per chain, based on correctness + state coherence + completeness)
| Condition | step_01 | step_02 | step_03 | **Mean** |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| A (Haiku Raw) | 10 | 8 | 9 | **9.0** |
| B (Haiku Scaffolded) | 10 | 8 | 8 | **8.7** |
| C (Sonnet Raw) | 10 | 9 | 8 | **9.0** |

### MULTI-STEP FINDINGS:
- **Interesting: Both B and C made the same counting error** (4 GET /api/users instead of 5). A (raw Haiku) got it right.
- **Sonnet's step_02 was more sophisticated** (ranked payment bug #1 over login bug, with nuanced revenue/compliance reasoning — arguably better but debatable)
- **State coherence was good across all three** — all carried results forward correctly
- **Scaffolding did NOT help multi-step** — slight degradation (-0.3). The constraint block may have added overhead without benefit on these tasks.

## AGGREGATE RESULTS

| Category | A (Haiku Raw) | B (Haiku Scaffolded) | C (Sonnet Raw) | B vs A (lift) | B vs C |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Evaluation (MAE, lower=better) | 2.0 | **1.0** | 1.2 | **+1.0pp** [OK] | **+0.2pp better** [OK] |
| Context (0-10) | 8.4 | **9.2** | **9.6** | **+0.8** [OK] | -0.4 |
| Multi-Step (0-10) | **9.0** | 8.7 | **9.0** | -0.3 | -0.3 |

### HEADLINE RESULTS:

**1. Scaffolded Haiku BEATS raw Sonnet on evaluation calibration.**
- B (MAE 1.0) < C (MAE 1.2). Haiku + prompt fixer is a better judge than raw Sonnet.
- This is the first task category where a cheaper model + scaffold outperforms the expensive model.

**2. Scaffolded Haiku closes 67% of the Haiku-Sonnet gap on context tasks.**
- A=8.4, B=9.2, C=9.6. Scaffold moved Haiku 67% of the way to Sonnet.

**3. Scaffolding did NOT help multi-step tasks.**
- Slight degradation. A planning scaffold may be needed here instead of the constraint scaffold.
- This confirms the pattern: scaffold = boost for incapability, not noise for capability. Haiku already handles multi-step well.

**4. The biggest scaffold wins were on evaluation calibration:**
- eval_05: Raw Haiku scored 8 (GT=5). Scaffolded scored 5 (exact match). The contrastive marker "Python's sort uses O(n) space. Claiming O(1) is wrong. Partially correct is 4-6. NOT 'close enough' (7+)" directly prevented overcorrection.
- eval_10: Raw scored 6 (GT=3). Scaffolded scored 3 (exact). "Hedged non-answers that deflect are low quality (2-4). NOT 'balanced' (6+)" worked.
- eval_02: Raw scored 2 (GT=7). Scaffolded scored 5. Prevented the false hallucination accusation.

## ROUTING TABLE (from this data)

| Task Type | Best Condition | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent evaluation / judging** | **B (Haiku + scaffold)** | Use scaffolded Haiku. BEATS Sonnet. |
| **Multi-context Q&A** | C (Sonnet raw) | Sonnet wins but scaffolded Haiku is close. Use Haiku for cost-sensitive, Sonnet for critical. |
| **Multi-step with state** | A or C (tie) | Scaffolding adds overhead. Use Haiku raw for simple chains, Sonnet for complex. |

---

## COST IMPLICATIONS

| Model | Input $/1M tokens | Output $/1M tokens | Relative Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Haiku | $0.80 | $4.00 | 1x |
| Sonnet | $3.00 | $15.00 | ~3.75x |
| Opus | $15.00 | $75.00 | ~18.75x |

**For evaluation tasks (where B > C):** Using scaffolded Haiku instead of Sonnet saves 73% with BETTER results.
**For context tasks (where B ≈ C):** Haiku + scaffold is 67% of the way there at 27% of the cost.

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Run PF-002:** Repeat with 3 runs per condition for statistical significance (this was n=1)
2. **Test planning scaffold on multi-step:** Category 3 may benefit from a plan-first scaffold
3. **Expand task suite:** Add code review, tool selection, memory retrieval categories
4. **Test on real agentic tasks:** Pull actual tasks from daily agent work logs
5. **Build the routing layer:** Implement the routing table as automated scaffold selection
